Changes Group 3 REDACTED
Anh Tran
Lisa Taylor
Nathaniel Toporek

We kept the same responsibilities. Nathan worked on ProgramChairUI, and GeneralUI, Anh worked on SubprogramChairUI, and ReviewerUI, and Lisa worked on AuthorUI

We changed Recommendations from an Object created when a recommendation is given from an SPC, to Enums because recommendations were not defined as a string but as values ranging from Strong Reject to Strong Accept.

We changed acceptance status from a Boolean to enums, so we can differentiate between pending papers and rejected / accepted papers.

We added a getManuscript function to the Conference class that contained the manuscripts belonging to a specific subprogram chair or reviewer, so we did not have to track of multiple lists of Manuscripts.

We got an exit functionality working using enums, instead of exiting after every action.

We separated our UI to multiple classes based on role for ease of reuse.

We changed test names to match specification and finalized conference tests.

We fixed removeManuscript in the author class, so it actually removed the paper.

We fixed the many edge cases when printing out Lists. The selection will start with 1, but the array starts with 0, so we had to compensate for that.

We had serialization problems while testing. Every time there was a problem, it got saved during serialization, so we had to reset everything.

Many of our lists were null when we passed them, so whenever we needed to list manuscripts, it would be empty. The problem was in the Manuscript classs.
